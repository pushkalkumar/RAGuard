{"query": "barriers to heart disease prevention", "gold_doc": "our understanding of coronary artery disease risk and the atherosclerotic process has changed greatly in recent years. for example, it is now known that angiographically apparent coronary artery plaque is not the major cause of myocardial infarction (mi). rather, it is unstable, soft plaque that cannot be seen angiographically that is prone to rupture and result in infarction. also important are changes in vascular reactivity resulting from diet. cholesterol levels by themselves reveal little about a patient's coronary artery disease risk. most infarctions occur in patients who have normal total cholesterol levels. at-risk patients can be identified using the ratio of total-to-high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol levels. the ratio of triglyceride to hdl cholesterol levels is also important. simple steps to assess patients' risk in practice are outlined. primary prevention trials demonstrate that coronary artery disease risk can be lowered dramatically with diet and drug therapy."}
{"query": "coffee", "gold_doc": "background caffeine consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of parkinson disease. the association is strong and consistent in men, but uncertain in women, possibly because of an interaction with hormone replacement therapy. we sought to confirm these findings using data on parkinson disease incidence in the cps ii nutrition cohort, a large prospective study of men and women. methods we conducted a prospective study of caffeine intake and risk of pd within the cancer prevention study ii nutrition cohort. intakes of coffee and other sources of caffeine were assessed at baseline. incident cases of pd (n = 317; 197 men and 120 women) were confirmed by treating physicians and medical record review. relative risks (rr) were estimated using proportional hazards models, adjusting for age, smoking and alcohol consumption. results after adjustment for age, smoking and alcohol intake, high caffeine consumption was associated with a reduced risk of pd. the relative risk comparing the 5th to the 1st quintile of caffeine intake was 0.43 (ci: 0.26, 0.71, p-trend = <0.002) in men, and 0.61 (95% ci: 0.34, 1.09; p for trend =0.05) in women. among women, this association was stronger among never users of hormone replacement therapy (rr=0.32) than among ever users (rr=0.81, p-interaction = 0.15). consumption of decaffeinated coffee was not associated with pd risk. conclusion findings from this large prospective study of men and women are consistent with a protective effect of caffeine intake on pd incidence, with an attenuating influence of hormone replacement therapy in women."}

{"query": "beans", "gold_doc": "this review describes the present state of knowledge about phytic acid (phytate), which is often present in legume seeds. the antinutritional effects of phytic acid primarily relate to the strong chelating associated with its six reactive phosphate groups. its ability to complex with proteins and particularly with minerals has been a subject of investigation from chemical and nutritional viewpoints. the hydrolysis of phytate into inositol and phosphates or phosphoric acid occurs as a result of phytase or nonenzymatic cleavage. enzymes capable of hydrolysing phytates are widely distributed in micro-organisms, plants and animals. phytases act in a stepwise manner to catalyse the hydrolysis of phytic acid. to reduce or eliminate the chelating ability of phytate, dephosphorylation of hexa- and penta-phosphate forms is essential since a high degree of phosphorylation is necessary to bind minerals. there are several methods of decreasing the inhibitory effect of phytic acid on mineral absorption (cooking, germination, fermentation, soaking, autolysis). nevertheless, inositol hexaphosphate is receiving increased attention owing to its role in cancer prevention and/or therapy and its hypocholesterolaemic effect."}

{"query": "junk food", "gold_doc": "the codex alimentarius definition of dietary fiber includes all nondigestible carbohydrate polymers with a degree of polymerization of 3 or more as dietary fiber with the proviso that they show health benefits. the global definition, if accepted by all authoritative bodies, offers a chance for international harmonization in research, food composition tables, and food labeling. its nonacceptance highlights problems that may develop when definitions vary by region. the definition requires that the research community agrees upon physiological effects for which there is substantial scientific agreement, e.g., fibers’ effects on laxation and gut health, on attenuating blood lipids and blood glucose and insulin, and in promoting fermentation in the large bowel. the definition also necessitates the delineation of research protocols to prove the benefits of various isolated and synthesized fibers. these should emanate from evidence-based reviews that fairly weigh epidemiological data while considering that added fibers are not reflected in many food composition databases. they then should include well-controlled, randomized, control trials and utilize animal studies to determine mechanisms. agreement on many study variables such as the type of subject and the type of baseline diet that best fits the question under investigation will also be needed. finally, the definition establishes that all types of fiber can address the severe fiber consumption gap that exists throughout the world by recognizing that the combination of fiber-rich and -fortified foods increases fiber intake while allowing consumers to stay within allowed energy levels."}

{"query": "pork", "gold_doc": "background: restriction of dietary phosphorus is a major aspect of patient care in those with renal disease. restriction of dietary phosphorus is necessary to control for phosphate balance during both conservative therapy and dialysis treatment. the extra amount of phosphorus which is consumed as a result of phosphate-containing food additives is a real challenge for patients with renal disease and for dieticians because it represents a \"hidden\" phosphate load. the objective of this study was to measure phosphorus content in foods, common protein sources in particular, and comprised both those which included a listing of phosphate additives and those which did not. methods: determinations of dry matter, nitrogen, total and soluble phosphate ions were carried out in 60 samples of foods, namely cooked ham, roast breast turkey, and roast breast chicken, of which, 30 were with declared phosphate additives and the other 30 similar items were without additives. results: total phosphorus (290 ± 40 mg/100 g vs. 185 ± 23 mg/100 g, p < .001) and soluble phosphorus (164 ± 25 mg/100 g vs. 100 ± 19 mg/100 g, p < .001) content were higher in products containing additives than in foods without additives. no difference was detected between the 2 groups regarding dry matter (27.2 ± 2.0 g/100 g vs. 26.7 ± 1.9 g/100 g) or total nitrogen (3.15 ± 0.40 g/100 g vs. 3.19 ± 0.40 g/100 g). consequently, phosphorus intake per gram of protein was much greater in the foods containing phosphorus additives (15.0 ± 3.1 mg/g vs. 9.3 ± 0.7 mg/g, p < .001). conclusions: our results show that those foods which contain phosphate additives have a phosphorus content nearly 70% higher than the samples which did not contain additives. this creates a special concern because this extra amount of phosphorus is almost completely absorbed by the intestinal tract. these hidden phosphates worsen phosphate balance control and increase the need for phosphate binders and related costs. information and educational programs are essential to make patients with renal disease aware of the existence of foods with phosphate additives. moreover, these facts highlight the need for national and international authorities to devote more attention to food labels which should clearly report the amount of natural or added phosphorus. copyright © 2011 national kidney foundation, inc. published by elsevier inc. all rights reserved."}

{"query": "chernobyl", "gold_doc": "the distribution and behaviour of the natural-series alpha-emitter polonium-210 in the marine environment has been under study for many years primarily due to its enhanced bioaccumulation, its strong affinity for binding with certain internal tissues, and its importance as a contributor to the natural radiation dose received by marine biota as well as humans consuming seafoods. results from studies spanning nearly 5 decades show that (210)po concentrations in organisms vary widely among the different phylogenic groups as well as between the different tissues of a given species. such variation results in (210)po concentration factors ranging from approximately 10(3) to over 10(6) depending upon the organism or tissue considered. (210)po/(210)pb ratios in marine species are generally greater than unity and tend to increase up the food chain indicating that (210)po is preferentially taken up by organisms compared to its progenitor (210)pb. the effective transfer of (210)po up the food chain is primarily due to the high degree of assimilation of the radionuclide from ingested food and its subsequent strong retention in the organisms. in some cases this mechanism may lead to an apparent biomagnification of (210)po at the higher trophic level. various pelagic species release (210)po and (210)pb packaged in organic biodetrital particles that sink and remove these radionuclides from the upper water column, a biogeochemical process which, coupled with scavenging rates of this radionuclide pair, is being examined as a possible proxy for estimating downward organic carbon fluxes in the sea. data related to preferential bioaccumulation in various organisms, their tissues, resultant radiation doses to these species, and the processes by which (210)po is transferred and recycled through the food web are discussed. in addition, the main gaps in our present knowledge and proposed areas for future studies on the biogeochemical behaviour of (210)po and its use as a tracer of oceanographic processes are highlighted in this review. copyright © 2010 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."}

{"query": "the answer to the pritikin puzzle", "gold_doc": "amino acids modulate the secretion of both insulin and glucagon; the composition of dietary protein therefore has the potential to influence the balance of glucagon and insulin activity. soy protein, as well as many other vegan proteins, are higher in non-essential amino acids than most animal-derived food proteins, and as a result should preferentially favor glucagon production. acting on hepatocytes, glucagon promotes (and insulin inhibits) camp-dependent mechanisms that down-regulate lipogenic enzymes and cholesterol synthesis, while up-regulating hepatic ldl receptors and production of the igf-i antagonist igfbp-1. the insulin-sensitizing properties of many vegan diets--high in fiber, low in saturated fat--should amplify these effects by down-regulating insulin secretion. additionally, the relatively low essential amino acid content of some vegan diets may decrease hepatic igf-i synthesis. thus, diets featuring vegan proteins can be expected to lower elevated serum lipid levels, promote weight loss, and decrease circulating igf-i activity. the latter effect should impede cancer induction (as is seen in animal studies with soy protein), lessen neutrophil-mediated inflammatory damage, and slow growth and maturation in children. in fact, vegans tend to have low serum lipids, lean physiques, shorter stature, later puberty, and decreased risk for certain prominent 'western' cancers; a vegan diet has documented clinical efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis. low-fat vegan diets may be especially protective in regard to cancers linked to insulin resistance--namely, breast and colon cancer--as well as prostate cancer; conversely, the high igf-i activity associated with heavy ingestion of animal products may be largely responsible for the epidemic of 'western' cancers in wealthy societies. increased phytochemical intake is also likely to contribute to the reduction of cancer risk in vegans. regression of coronary stenoses has been documented during low-fat vegan diets coupled with exercise training; such regimens also tend to markedly improve diabetic control and lower elevated blood pressure. risk of many other degenerative disorders may be decreased in vegans, although reduced growth factor activity may be responsible for an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. by altering the glucagon/insulin balance, it is conceivable that supplemental intakes of key non-essential amino acids could enable omnivores to enjoy some of the health advantages of a vegan diet. an unnecessarily high intake of essential amino acids--either in the absolute sense or relative to total dietary protein--may prove to be as grave a risk factor for 'western' degenerative diseases as is excessive fat intake."}

{"query": "milk", "gold_doc": "epidemiological evidence points to increased dairy and meat consumption, staples of the western diet, as major risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes (t2d). this paper presents a new concept and comprehensive review of leucine-mediated cell signaling explaining the pathogenesis of t2d and obesity by leucine-induced over-stimulation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1). mtorc1, a pivotal nutrient-sensitive kinase, promotes growth and cell proliferation in response to glucose, energy, growth factors and amino acids. dairy proteins and meat stimulate insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling and provide high amounts of leucine, a primary and independent stimulator for mtorc1 activation. the downstream target of mtorc1, the kinase s6k1, induces insulin resistance by phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, thereby increasing the metabolic burden of β-cells. moreover, leucine-mediated mtorc1-s6k1-signaling plays an important role in adipogenesis, thus increasing the risk of obesity-mediated insulin resistance. high consumption of leucine-rich proteins explains exaggerated mtorc1-dependent insulin secretion, increased β-cell growth and β-cell proliferation promoting an early onset of replicative β-cell senescence with subsequent β-cell apoptosis. disturbances of β-cell mass regulation with increased β-cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as insulin resistance are hallmarks of t2d, which are all associated with hyperactivation of mtorc1. in contrast, the anti-diabetic drug metformin antagonizes leucine-mediated mtorc1 signaling. plant-derived polyphenols and flavonoids are identified as natural inhibitors of mtorc1 and exert anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects. furthermore, bariatric surgery in obesity reduces increased plasma levels of leucine and other branched-chain amino acids. attenuation of leucine-mediated mtorc1 signaling by defining appropriate upper limits of the daily intake of leucine-rich animal and dairy proteins may offer a great chance for the prevention of t2d and obesity, as well as other epidemic diseases of civilization with increased mtorc1 signaling, especially cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, which are frequently associated with t2d."}

{"query": "junk food", "gold_doc": "high-level cadmium (cd) exposure has long been known to induce nephropathy, severe osteoporosis, and fractures in humans. more recent epidemiology, however, reveals that, in populations not known to have important industrial exposure to this heavy metal, high-normal blood or urine cd levels correlate with increased risk for vascular disorders, cancers, diabetes, and total mortality, as well as osteoporosis and nephropathy. since these disorders appear unlikely to expedite cd absorption, and since cd has promoted these pathologies in rodent studies, it seems reasonable to conclude that cd is an important mediating risk factor for these disorders in humans. avoiding tobacco smoke or frequent ingestion of shellfish or organ meats can lessen humans exposure to cd, but the chief dietary sources of cd are plant-derived foods - green leafy vegetables, whole grains, tubers, and root vegetables - typically recommended for their health-supportive properties; indeed, among non-smokers, vegans tend to have the highest cd body burden. fortunately, iron sufficiency and ample dietary intakes of calcium, magnesium, and zinc can impede absorption of dietary cd, both by down-regulating intestinal expression of mineral transporters, and by directly competing with cd for access to these transporters. correction of iron deficiency appears to be of particular importance for controlling cd absorption. moreover, zinc supplementation can counteract the toxicity of cd already in the body via induction of metallothionein, which binds cd avidly via its sulfhydryl groups; so long as it remains sequestered in this form, cd is innocuous. zinc supplementation may in any case be recommendable, as optimal zinc status exerts protective anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunosupportive effects. inasmuch as the toxicity of cd appears to be mediated in large part by oxidative stress, ingestion of spirulina, lipoic acid, melatonin, and n-acetylcysteine may also have potential for mitigating the risk associated with cd exposure, as suggested by rodent studies. hence, although cd may prove to be a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in humans, practical strategies for limiting its absorption and pathogenic impact are at hand. copyright © 2012 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."}

{"query": "grapes", "gold_doc": "the relative proportion of bacteroidetes to firmicutes is decreased in obese people. this imbalance in gut microbiota generates signals controlling the expression of genes by the epithelial intestinal cells. both dairy and non-dairy probiotics increase body weight, reportedly through lactobacillus species growth in the gut. on the other hand, daily intake of some fruits and drinks such as three apples or three pears or grapefruit, or green tea, which all are rich in polyphenols, can significantly reduce body weight in obese people. metabolism of polyphenols by microbiota involves the cleavage of glycosidic linkages. glycans, which are the product of glycosidic cleavage, are necessary for survival of the intestinal microbiota as a nutrient foundation. there are two pivotal points: (i) firmicutes possess a disproportionately smaller number of glycan-degrading enzymes than bacteroidetes, (ii) firmicutes are more repressed than the bacteroidetes by phenolic compounds' antimicrobial properties. the bacteroidetes community prevails following dietary polyphenol intake and its fermentation to phenolic compounds, due to having more glycan-degrading enzymes, so this may thus be a mechanism by which dietary polyphenols exert their weight lowering effect. i suggest that future studies utilize clone libraries and fingerprinting techniques enabling identification of the composition and community structure of the microbiota, and dot blot hybridization or fluorescent in situ hybridization to analyze abundance of particular taxa in obese and individuals. a supplementation with polyphenols with high bioavailability in obese individuals with higher firmicutes/bacteroides community ratio phenotype, when associated to a probiotic restricted diet, is proposed for weight loss; this hypothesis could have relevant implication in planning a successful dietary regimen and/or neutraceutical/pharmaceutical preparations for achieving and maintaining a normal body weight in obese individuals, especially including much more use of polyphenol-rich foodstuffs and/or polyphenol-rich syrups, and including low amounts of probiotic-rich foodstuffs like yogurt, soy yogurt, or as probiotic supplements. copyright © 2010 elsevier ireland ltd. all rights reserved."}

{"query": "nuts", "gold_doc": "background and aims: high blood pressure (bp) is considered a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. among lifestyle factors, diet plays a key role in the prevention and control of high bp. therefore, it is important to elucidate which dietary components can exert beneficial effects on bp through modulation of endothelial function (ef) or by other mechanisms. in this paper we review the role of nutrients, foods, particularly nuts, and dietary patterns on bp control. data synthesis: because nuts are low in sodium and contain significant amounts of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, fiber, minerals such as magnesium, potassium and calcium, and antioxidants, they have been suggested as potentially protective foods against hypertension. limited evidence from prospective studies and clinical trials suggests that nut consumption has a beneficial effect on both bp and ef. however, bp changes were a secondary outcome in nut feeding trials and no study used ambulatory bp monitoring as the standard for bp measurements. conclusions: further clinical trials, ideally using ambulatory bp monitoring, are needed to establish the potential protective effect of nut consumption on hypertension and vascular reactivity. copyright © 2011 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."}

(210)po/(210)pb ratios in marine species are generally greater than unity and tend to increase up the food chain indicating that (210)po is preferentially taken up by organisms compared to its progenitor (210)pb. the effective transfer of (210)po up the food chain is primarily due to the high degree of assimilation of the radionuclide from ingested food and its subsequent strong retention in the organisms. in some cases this mechanism may lead to an apparent biomagnification of (210)po at the higher trophic level. various pelagic species release (210)po and (210)pb packaged in organic biodetrital particles that sink and remove these radionuclides from the upper water column, a biogeochemical process which, coupled with scavenging rates of this radionuclide pair, is being examined as a possible proxy for estimating downward organic carbon fluxes in the sea. data related to preferential bioaccumulation in various organisms, their tissues, resultant radiation doses to these species, and the processes by which (210)po is transferred and recycled through the food web are discussed. in addition, the main gaps in our present knowledge and proposed areas for future studies on the biogeochemical behaviour of (210)po and its use as a tracer of oceanographic processes are highlighted in this review. copyright © 2010 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."}

{"query": "beans", "gold_doc": "background the word selectivity describes a drug's ability to affect a particular cell population in preference to others. as part of the current state of art in the search for new therapeutic agents, the property of selectivity is a mode of action thought to have a high degree of desirability. consequently there is a growing activity in this area of research. selectivity is generally a worthy property in a drug because a drug having high selectivity may have a dramatic effect when there is a single agent that can be targeted against the appropriate molecular-driver involved in the pathogenesis of a disease. an example is chronic myeloid leukemia (cml). cml has a specific chromosomal abnormality, the philadelphia chromosome, that results in a single gene that produces an abnormal protein discussion there is a burgeoning understanding of the cellular mechanisms that control the etiology and pathogeneses of diseases. this understanding both enables and motivates the development of drugs that induce a specific action in a selected cell population; i.e., a targeted treatment. consequently, drugs that can target distinct molecular targets involved in pathologic/pathogenetic processes, or signal-transduction pathways, are being developed. however, in most cases, diseases involve multiple abnormalities. a disease may be associated with more than one dysfunctional protein and these may be out-of-balance with each other. likewise a drug might strongly target a protein that shares a similar active domain with other proteins. a drug may also target pleiotropic cytokines, or other proteins that have multi-physiological functions. in this way multiple normal cellular pathways can be simultaneously influenced. long term experience with drugs supposedly designed for only a single target, but which unavoidably involve other functional effects, is uncovering the fact that molecular targeting is not medically flawless. summary we contend that an ideal drug may be one whose efficacy is based not on the inhibition of a single target, but rather on the rebalancing of the several proteins or events, that contribute to the etiology, pathogeneses, and progression of diseases, i.e., in effect a promiscuous drug. ideally, if this could be done at minimum drug concentration, side effects could be minimized. corollaries to this argument are that the growing fervor for researching truly selective drugs may be imprudent when considering the totality of responses; and that the expensive screening techniques used to discover these, may be both medically and financially inefficient."}
{"query": "insects", "gold_doc": "available information indicates that long-lived mammals have low rates of reactive oxygen species (ros) generation and oxidative damage at their mitochondria. on the other hand, many studies have consistently shown that dietary restriction (dr) in rodents also decreases mitochondrial ros (mtros) production and oxidative damage to mitochondrial dna and proteins. it has been observed that protein restriction also decreases mtros generation and oxidative stress in rat liver, whereas neither carbohydrate nor lipid restriction change these parameters. this is interesting because protein restriction also increases maximum longevity in rodents (although to a lower extent than dr) and is a much more practicable intervention for humans than dr, whereas neither carbohydrate nor lipid restriction seem to change rodent longevity. moreover, it has been found that isocaloric methionine restriction also decreases mtros generation and oxidative stress in rodent tissues, and this manipulation also increases maximum longevity in rats and mice. in addition, excessive dietary methionine also increases mtros generation in rat liver. these studies suggest that the reduced intake of dietary methionine can be responsible for the decrease in mitochondrial ros generation and the ensuing oxidative damage that occurs during dr, as well as for part of the increase in maximum longevity induced by this dietary manipulation. in addition, the mean intake of proteins (and thus methionine) of western human populations is much higher than needed. therefore, decreasing such levels to the recommended ones has a great potential to lower tissue oxidative stress and to increase healthy life span in humans while avoiding the possible undesirable effects of dr diets."}

{"query": "smoking", "gold_doc": "the distribution and behaviour of the natural-series alpha-emitter polonium-210 in the marine environment has been under study for many years primarily due to its enhanced bioaccumulation, its strong affinity for binding with certain internal tissues, and its importance as a contributor to the natural radiation dose received by marine biota as well as humans consuming seafoods. results from studies spanning nearly 5 decades show that (210)po concentrations in organisms vary widely among the different phylogenic groups as well as between the different tissues of a given species. such variation results in (210)po concentration factors ranging from approximately 10(3) to over 10(6) depending upon the organism or tissue considered. (210)po/(210)pb ratios in marine species are generally greater than unity and tend to increase up the food chain indicating that (210)po is preferentially taken up by organisms compared to its progenitor (210)pb. the effective transfer of (210)po up the food chain is primarily due to the high degree of assimilation of the radionuclide from ingested food and its subsequent strong retention in the organisms. in some cases this mechanism may lead to an apparent biomagnification of (210)po at the higher trophic level. various pelagic species release (210)po and (210)pb packaged in organic biodetrital particles that sink and remove these radionuclides from the upper water column, a biogeochemical process which, coupled with scavenging rates of this radionuclide pair, is being examined as a possible proxy for estimating downward organic carbon fluxes in the sea. data related to preferential bioaccumulation in various organisms, their tissues, resultant radiation doses to these species, and the processes by which (210)po is transferred and recycled through the food web are discussed. in addition, the main gaps in our present knowledge and proposed areas for future studies on the biogeochemical behaviour of (210)po and its use as a tracer of oceanographic processes are highlighted in this review. copyright © 2010 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."}

{"query": "beans", "gold_doc": "several epidemiological studies have indicated that abundant consumption of foods from plant origin is associated with a reduced risk of developing several types of cancers. this chemopreventive effect is related to the high content of these foods in phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, that interfere with several processes involved in cancer progression including tumor cell growth, survival and angiogenesis. in addition to the low intake of plant-based foods, increased body mass and physical inactivity have recently emerged as other important lifestyle factors influencing cancer risk, leading to the generation of low-grade chronic inflammatory conditions which are a key process involved in tumor progression. the objectives of the current study are to investigate the inhibitory effects of these polyphenols on angiogenesis triggered by an inflammatory cytokine (il-6) and to determine the mechanisms underlying this action. we found that, among the tested polyphenols, apigenin and luteolin were the most potent angiogenesis inhibitors through their inhibitory effect on the inflammatory cytokine il-6/stat3 pathway. these effects resulted in modulation of the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 signaling triggered by il-6, as well as in a marked reduction in the proliferation, migration and morphogenic differentiation of endothelial cells. interestingly, these polyphenols also modulated the expression of il-6 signal transducing receptor (il-6rα) and the secretion of the extracellular matrix degrading enzyme mmp-2 as well as the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (socs3) protein. overall, these results may provide important new information on the role of diet in cancer prevention. copyright © 2012 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."}

{"query": "milk", "gold_doc": "research leading to the discovery of a series of mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (hcas) was inspired by the idea that smoke produced during cooking of food, especially meat or fish, might be carcinogenic. more than ten kinds of hcas, actually produced by cooking or heating of meat or fish, have now been isolated and their structures determined, most being previously unregistered compounds. they are highly mutagenic towards salmonella typhimurium in the presence of s9 mix and are also mutagenic in vitro and in vivo toward mammalian cells. hcas have now been chemically synthesized in quantity and subjected to long-term animal testing. when hcas were fed in the diet, rodents developed cancers in many organs, including the colon, breast and prostate, and one hca produced hepatomas in monkeys. the lesions exhibited alteration in genes including apc, beta-catenin and ha-ras, and these changes provide clues to the induction mechanisms. the hcas are oxidized to hydroxyamino derivatives by cytochrome p450s, and further converted to ester forms by acetyltransferase and sulfotransferase. eventually, they produce dna adducts through the formation of n-c bonds at guanine bases. there are hca-sensitive and resistant strains of rodents and a search for the responsible genes is now under way. while the content of hcas in dishes consumed in ordinary life is low and not sufficient in itself to explain human cancer, the coexistence of many other mutagens/carcinogens of either autobiotic or xenobiotic type and the possibility that hcas induce genomic instability and heightened sensitivity to tumor promoters suggest that avoidance of exposure to hcas or reduction of hcas' biological effects as far as possible are to be highly recommended. usage of microwave ovens for cooking and supplementation of the diet, for example with soy-isoflavones, which have been found to suppress the occurrence of hca-induced breast cancers, should be encouraged. advice to the general public about how to reduce the carcinogenic load imposed by hcas would be an important contribution to cancer prevention."}

{"query": "pork", "gold_doc": "evolutionary paradigms of human health and nutrition center on the evolutionary discordance or “mismatch” model whereby human bodies, reflecting adaptations established in the paleolithic era, are ill-suited to modern industrialized diets resulting in rapidly increasing rates of chronic metabolic disease. whereas this model remains useful, we argue that its utility in explaining the evolution of human dietary tendencies is limited. the assumption that human diets are mismatched to our evolved biology implies that they are instinctual or genetically determined and rooted in the paleolithic. we review current research indicating that human eating habits are primarily learned through behavioral, social and physiological mechanisms starting in utero and extending throughout the life course. those adaptations that appear to be strongly genetic likely reflect neolithic, rather than paleolithic, adaptations and are significantly influenced by human niche-constructing behavior. incorporating a broader understanding of the evolved mechanisms by which humans learn and imprint eating habits and the reciprocal effects of those habits on physiology would provide useful tools for structuring more lasting nutrition interventions."}

{"query": "trans fats", "gold_doc": "importance: understanding the major health problems in the united states and how they are changing over time is critical for informing national health policy. objectives: to measure the burden of diseases, injuries, and leading risk factors in the united states from 1990 to 2010 and to compare these measurements with those of the 34 countries in the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) countries. design: we used the systematic analysis of descriptive epidemiology of 291 diseases and injuries, 1160 sequelae of these diseases and injuries, and 67 risk factors or clusters of risk factors from 1990 to 2010 for 187 countries developed for the global burden of disease 2010 study to describe the health status of the united states and to compare us health outcomes with those of 34 oecd countries. years of life lost due to premature mortality (ylls) were computed by multiplying the number of deaths at each age by a reference life expectancy at that age. years lived with disability (ylds) were calculated by multiplying prevalence (based on systematic reviews) by the disability weight (based on population-based surveys) for each sequela; disability in this study refers to any short- or long-term loss of health. disability-adjusted life-years (dalys) were estimated as the sum of ylds and ylls. deaths and dalys related to risk factors were based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses of exposure data and relative risks for risk-outcome pairs. healthy life expectancy (hale) was used to summarize overall population health, accounting for both length of life and levels of ill health experienced at different ages. results: us life expectancy for both sexes combined increased from 75.2 years in 1990 to 78.2 years in 2010; during the same period, hale increased from 65.8 years to 68.1 years. the diseases and injuries with the largest number of ylls in 2010 were ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and road injury. age-standardized yll rates increased for alzheimer disease, drug use disorders, chronic kidney disease, kidney cancer, and falls. the diseases with the largest number of ylds in 2010 were low back pain, major depressive disorder, other musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety disorders. as the us population has aged, ylds have comprised a larger share of dalys than have ylls. the leading risk factors related to dalys were dietary risks, tobacco smoking, high body mass index, high blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. among 34 oecd countries between 1990 and 2010, the us rank for the age-standardized death rate changed from 18th to 27th, for the age-standardized yll rate from 23rd to 28th, for the age-standardized yld rate from 5th to 6th, for life expectancy at birth from 20th to 27th, and for hale from 14th to 26th. conclusions and relevance: from 1990 to 2010, the united states made substantial progress in improving health. life expectancy at birth and hale increased, all-cause death rates at all ages decreased, and age-specific rates of years lived with disability remained stable. however, morbidity and chronic disability now account for nearly half of the us health burden, and improvements in population health in the united states have not kept pace with advances in population health in other wealthy nations."}
{"query": "saturated fat", "gold_doc": "background: reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. in the global burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors study 2010 (gbd 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (uis), separately by age and sex. methods: we attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. we assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. we applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. for 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the cause of death ensemble model (codem) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. model ensembles were developed from these component models. we assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95% uis. for 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. for 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the gbd 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. for selected causes (african trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis e, and hiv/aids), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. we separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. for deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. for every cause, we estimated 95% uis that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where codem was used. we constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. findings: in 2010, there were 52·8 million deaths globally. at the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24·9% of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15·9 million (34·1%) of 46·5 million in 1990. this decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2·5 to 1·4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3·4 to 2·8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3·1 to 2·2 million), measles (from 0·63 to 0·13 million), and tetanus (from 0·27 to 0·06 million). deaths from hiv/aids increased from 0·30 million in 1990 to 1·5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1·7 million in 2006. malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19·9% since 1990 to 1·17 million deaths in 2010. tuberculosis killed 1·2 million people in 2010. deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34·5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38% more than two decades ago; of these, 1·5 million (19%) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12·9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1·3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. the fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5·1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9·6%) compared with two decades earlier (8·8%). this was driven by a 46% rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1·3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and hiv/aids were the leading causes of death in 2010. ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and hiv/aids were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (ylls) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for hiv/aids and preterm birth complications. ylls from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54% since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke ylls increased by 17-28%. regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76% of premature mortality in sub-saharan africa in 2010. age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (hiv/aids, alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, copd, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. for other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted. interpretation: population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of ylls in sub-saharan africa. overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, chagas disease, african trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis. funding: bill & melinda gates foundation. copyright © 2012 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."}

{"query": "muscle health", "gold_doc": "a complex system of interacting mediators exists in the gastric mucosa to strengthen its resistance against injury. in this system prostaglandins play an important role. prostaglandin biosynthesis is catalysed by the enzyme cyclooxygenase (cox), which exists in two isoforms, cox-1 and cox-2. initially the concept was developed that cox-1 functions as housekeeping enzyme, whereas cox-2 yields prostaglandins involved in pathophysiological reactions such as inflammation. in the gastrointestinal tract, the maintenance of mucosal integrity was attributed exclusively to cox-1 without a contribution of cox-2 and ulcerogenic effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) were believed to be the consequence of inhibition of cox-1. recent findings, however, indicate that both cox-1 and cox-2 either alone or in concert contribute to gastric mucosal defence. thus, in normal rat gastric mucosa specific inhibition of cox-1 does not elicit mucosal lesions despite near-maximal suppression of gastric prostaglandin formation. when a selective cox-2 inhibitor which is not ulcerogenic when given alone is added to the cox-1 inhibitor, severe gastric damage develops. in contrast to normal gastric mucosa which requires simultaneous inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 for breakdown of mucosal resistance, in the acid-challenged rat stomach inhibition of cox-1 alone results in dose-dependent injury which is further increased by additional inhibition of cox-2 enzyme activity or prevention of acid-induced up-regulation of cox-2 expression by dexamethasone. cox-2 inhibitors do not damage the normal or acid-challenged gastric mucosa when given alone. however, when nitric oxide formation is suppressed or afferent nerves are defunctionalized, specific inhibition of cox-2 induces severe gastric damage. ischemia-reperfusion of the gastric artery is associated with up-regulation of cox-2 but not cox-1 mrna. cox-2 inhibitors or dexamethasone augment ischemia-reperfusion-induced gastric damage up to four-fold, an effect abolished by concurrent administration of 16,16-dimethyl-pge(2). selective inhibition of cox-1 is less effective. furthermore, cox-2 inhibitors antagonize the protective effect of a mild irritant or intragastric peptone perfusion in the rat stomach, whereas the protection induced by chronic administration of endotoxin is mediated by cox-1. finally, an important function of cox-2 is the acceleration of ulcer healing. cox-2 is up-regulated in chronic gastric ulcers and inhibitors of cox-2 impair the healing of ulcers to the same extent as non-selective nsaids. taken together, these observations show that both cox isoenzymes are essential factors in mucosal defence with specific contributions in various physiological and pathophysiological situations."}

{"query": "beans", "gold_doc": "methionine is an essential amino acid with many key roles in mammalian metabolism such as protein synthesis, methylation of dna and polyamine synthesis. restriction of methionine may be an important strategy in cancer growth control particularly in cancers that exhibit dependence on methionine for survival and proliferation. methionine dependence in cancer may be due to one or a combination of deletions, polymorphisms or alterations in expression of genes in the methionine de novo and salvage pathways. cancer cells with these defects are unable to regenerate methionine via these pathways. defects in the metabolism of folate may also contribute to the methionine dependence phenotype in cancer. selective killing of methionine dependent cancer cells in co-culture with normal cells has been demonstrated using culture media deficient in methionine. several animal studies utilizing a methionine restricted diet have reported inhibition of cancer growth and extension of a healthy life-span. in humans, vegan diets, which can be low in methionine, may prove to be a useful nutritional strategy in cancer growth control. the development of methioninase which depletes circulating levels of methionine may be another useful strategy in limiting cancer growth. the application of nutritional methionine restriction and methioninase in combination with chemotherapeutic regimens is the current focus of clinical studies. copyright © 2012 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."}

{"query": "dr. dean ornish", "gold_doc": "background: telomeres are protective dna-protein complexes at the end of linear chromosomes that promote chromosomal stability. telomere shortness in human beings is emerging as a prognostic marker of disease risk, progression, and premature mortality in many types of cancer, including breast, prostate, colorectal, bladder, head and neck, lung, and renal cell. telomere shortening is counteracted by the cellular enzyme telomerase. lifestyle factors known to promote cancer and cardiovascular disease might also adversely affect telomerase function. however, previous studies have not addressed whether improvements in nutrition and lifestyle are associated with increases in telomerase activity. we aimed to assess whether 3 months of intensive lifestyle changes increased telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). methods: 30 men with biopsy-diagnosed low-risk prostate cancer were asked to make comprehensive lifestyle changes. the primary endpoint was telomerase enzymatic activity per viable cell, measured at baseline and after 3 months. 24 patients had sufficient pbmcs needed for longitudinal analysis. this study is registered on the clinicaltrials.gov website, number nct00739791. findings: pbmc telomerase activity expressed as natural logarithms increased from 2.00 (sd 0.44) to 2.22 (sd 0.49; p=0.031). raw values of telomerase increased from 8.05 (sd 3.50) standard arbitrary units to 10.38 (sd 6.01) standard arbitrary units. the increases in telomerase activity were significantly associated with decreases in low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol (r=-0.36, p=0.041) and decreases in psychological distress (r=-0.35, p=0.047). interpretation: comprehensive lifestyle changes significantly increase telomerase activity and consequently telomere maintenance capacity in human immune-system cells. given this finding and the pilot nature of this study, we report these increases in telomerase activity as a significant association rather than inferring causation. larger randomised controlled trials are warranted to confirm the findings of this study."}

{"query": "junk food", "gold_doc": "the ongoing epidemics of obesity is one main health concern of the present time. overeating in some obese individuals shares similarities with the loss of control and compulsive behavior observed in drug-addicted subjects, suggesting that obesity may involve food addiction. here, we review the contributions provided by the use of positron emission tomography to the current understanding of the cerebral control of obesity and food intake in humans. the available studies have shown that multiple areas in the brain are involved with the reward properties of food, such as prefrontal, orbitofrontal, somatosensory cortices, insula, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and others. this review summarizes the current evidence, supporting the concepts that i) regions involved in the somatosensory response to food sight, taste, and smell are activated by palatable foods and may be hyperresponsive in obese individuals, ii) areas controlling executive drive seem to overreact to the anticipation of pleasure during cue exposure, and iii) those involved in cognitive control and inhibitory behavior may be resistant to the perception of reward after food exposure in obese subjects. all of these features may stimulate, for different reasons, ingestion of highly palatable and energy-rich foods. though these same regions are similarly involved in drug abusers and game-addicted individuals, any direct resemblance may be an oversimplification, especially as the heterogeneities between studies and the prevalent exclusion of sensitive groups still limit a coherent interpretation of the findings. further work is required to comprehensively tackle the multifaceted phenotype of obesity and identify the role of food dependency in its pathophysiology. copyright © 2012 s. karger gmbh, freiburg."}

{"query": "preventing brain loss with b vitamins?", "gold_doc": "in the 21st century, human aging will be one of the biggest challenges for most societies throughout the world. the decline in human fitness is a typical hallmark of the aging process. aside from the cardiovascular system, the brain most often suffers significantly from the life-long impact of stressors, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. oxytosis, i.e. oxidative stress-induced cell death, has been identified to play a major role in the development and onset of chronic diseases. foods, especially of plant origin, are rich in antioxidants and numerous in vivo data suggest that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables supports the maintenance of animal and human health. these beneficial effects also extend to the central nervous system, which, due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier, tightly controls the influx of metabolites and nutrients. in earlier studies the impact of antioxidant vitamins, such as alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid, on brain health has been of interest. recently, the focus moved to assessing the potential of unsaturated fatty acids and secondary plant metabolites, particularly of polyphenols, to act as neuroprotectants. considerable experimental evidence suggests that polyphenols and other plant-derived bioactivities affect animal and human brain function not only by directly lowering oxidative stress load but also by modulating various signal transduction pathways."}
