{"query": "grapes", "gold_doc": "objective: migratory capacity of endothelial progenitor cells (epcs) and mature endothelial cells (ecs) is a key prerequisite for endothelial repair after denuding injury or endothelial damage. methods and results: we demonstrate that caffeine in physiologically relevant concentrations (50 to 100 micromol/l) induces migration of human epcs as well as mature ecs. in patients with coronary artery disease (cad), caffeinated coffee increased caffeine serum concentration from 2 micromol/l to 23 micromol/l, coinciding with a significant increase in migratory activity of patient-derived epcs. decaffeinated coffee neither affected caffeine serum levels nor migratory capacity of epcs. treatment with caffeine for 7 to 10 days in a mouse-model improved endothelial repair after denudation of the carotid artery. the enhancement of reendothelialization by caffeine was significantly reduced in ampk knockout mice compared to wild-type animals. transplantation of wild-type and ampk(-/-) bone marrow into wild-type mice revealed no difference in caffeine challenged reendothelialization. ecs which were depleted of mitochondrial dna did not migrate when challenged with caffeine, suggesting a potential role for mitochondria in caffeine-dependent migration. conclusions: these results provide evidence that caffeine enhances endothelial cell migration and reendothelialization in part through an ampk-dependent mechanism, suggesting a beneficial role for caffeine in endothelial repair."}

{"query": "cooking methods", "gold_doc": "background: evidence-based strategies for promoting vegetable consumption among children are limited. objective: to determine the effects of providing a palatable “dip” along with repeated exposure to a raw vegetable on preschoolers' liking and intake. participants: one hundred fifty-two predominately hispanic preschool-aged children studied in head start classrooms in 2008. design: a between-subjects, quasiexperimental design was used. a moderately-liked raw vegetable (broccoli) was offered twice weekly at afternoon snacks for 7 weeks. classrooms were randomized to receive broccoli in one of four conditions differing in the provision of dip. bitter taste sensitivity was assessed using 6-n-propylthiouracil. intervention: broccoli was provided in four conditions: with regular salad dressing as a dip, with a light (reduced energy/fat) version of the dressing as a dip, mixed with the regular dressing as a sauce, or plain (without dressing). main outcome measures: mean broccoli intake during 7 weeks of exposure and broccoli liking following exposure. statistical analyses: descriptive statistics were generated. multilevel models for repeated measures tested effects of condition and bitter sensitivity on mean broccoli intake during exposure and on pre- and post-exposure liking while adjusting for classroom effects and potential covariates. results: the majority of hispanic preschoolers (70%) showed sensitivity to the bitter taste of 6-n-propylthiouracil. children's broccoli liking increased following exposure but did not vary by dip condition or bitter sensitivity. bitter-sensitive children, however, ate 80% more broccoli with dressing than when served plain (p<0.001); effects did vary based on whether regular or light dressing was provided as a dip or sauce. dip did not promote broccoli intake among bitter-insensitive children. conclusions: providing dip—regular, light, or as a sauce—increased raw broccoli intake among bitter-sensitive hispanic preschoolers. findings suggest that offering low-fat dips can promote vegetable intake among some children who are sensitive to bitter tastes."}

{"query": "grapes", "gold_doc": "the effect of meat consumption on cancer risk is a controversial issue. however, recent meta-analyses show that high consumers of cured meats and red meat are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. this increase is significant but modest (20-30%). current wcrf-aicr recommendations are to eat no more than 500 g per week of red meat, and to avoid processed meat. moreover, our studies show that beef meat and cured pork meat promote colon carcinogenesis in rats. the major promoter in meat is heme iron, via n-nitrosation or fat peroxidation. dietary additives can suppress the toxic effects of heme iron. for instance, promotion of colon carcinogenesis in rats by cooked, nitrite-treated and oxidized high-heme cured meat was suppressed by dietary calcium and by α-tocopherol, and a study in volunteers supported these protective effects in humans. these additives, and others still under study, could provide an acceptable way to prevent colorectal cancer. copyright © 2011 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved."}

{"query": "global burden of disease study", "gold_doc": "background: reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. in the global burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors study 2010 (gbd 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (uis), separately by age and sex. methods: we attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. we assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. we applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. for 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the cause of death ensemble model (codem) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. model ensembles were developed from these component models. we assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95% uis. for 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. for 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the gbd 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. for selected causes (african trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis e, and hiv/aids), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. we separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. for deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. for every cause, we estimated 95% uis that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where codem was used. we constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. findings: in 2010, there were 52·8 million deaths globally. at the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24·9% of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15·9 million (34·1%) of 46·5 million in 1990. this decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2·5 to 1·4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3·4 to 2·8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3·1 to 2·2 million), measles (from 0·63 to 0·13 million), and tetanus (from 0·27 to 0·06 million). deaths from hiv/aids increased from 0·30 million in 1990 to 1·5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1·7 million in 2006. malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19·9% since 1990 to 1·17 million deaths in 2010. tuberculosis killed 1·2 million people in 2010. deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34·5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38% more than two decades ago; of these, 1·5 million (19%) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12·9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1·3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. the fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5·1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9·6%) compared with two decades earlier (8·8%). this was driven by a 46% rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1·3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and hiv/aids were the leading causes of death in 2010. ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and hiv/aids were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (ylls) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for hiv/aids and preterm birth complications. ylls from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54% since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke ylls increased by 17-28%. regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76% of premature mortality in sub-saharan africa in 2010. age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (hiv/aids, alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, copd, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. for other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted. interpretation: population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of ylls in sub-saharan africa. overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, chagas disease, african trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis. funding: bill & melinda gates foundation. copyright © 2012 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."}

{"query": "pesticides", "gold_doc": "background and aims: the mechanisms of cancer cell growth and metastasis are still not entirely understood, especially from the viewpoint of chemical reactions in tumours. glycolytic metabolism is markedly accelerated in cancer cells, causing the accumulation of glucose (a reducing sugar) and methionine (an amino acid), which can non-enzymatically react and form carcinogenic substances. there is speculation that this reaction produces gaseous sulfur-containing compounds in tumour tissue. the aims of this study were to clarify the products in tumour and to investigate their effect on tumour proliferation. methods: products formed in the reaction between glucose and methionine or its metabolites were analysed in vitro using gas chromatography. flatus samples from patients with colon cancer and exhaled air samples from patients with lung cancer were analysed using near-edge x-ray fine adsorption structure spectroscopy and compared with those from healthy individuals. the tumour proliferation rates of mice into which ht29 human colon cancer cells had been implanted were compared with those of mice in which the cancer cells were surrounded by sodium hyaluronate gel to prevent diffusion of gaseous material into the healthy cells. results: gaseous sulfur-containing compounds such as methanethiol and hydrogen sulfide were produced when glucose was allowed to react with methionine or its metabolites homocysteine or cysteine. near-edge x-ray fine adsorption structure spectroscopy showed that the concentrations of sulfur-containing compounds in the samples of flatus from patients with colon cancer and in the samples of exhaled air from patients with lung cancer were significantly higher than in those from healthy individuals. animal experiments showed that preventing the diffusion of sulfur-containing compounds had a pronounced antitumour effect. conclusions: gaseous sulfur-containing compounds are the main products in tumours and preventing the diffusion of these compounds reduces the tumour proliferation rate, which suggests the possibility of a new approach to cancer treatment."}

{"query": "leucine", "gold_doc": "epidemiological evidence points to increased dairy and meat consumption, staples of the western diet, as major risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes (t2d). this paper presents a new concept and comprehensive review of leucine-mediated cell signaling explaining the pathogenesis of t2d and obesity by leucine-induced over-stimulation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1). mtorc1, a pivotal nutrient-sensitive kinase, promotes growth and cell proliferation in response to glucose, energy, growth factors and amino acids. dairy proteins and meat stimulate insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling and provide high amounts of leucine, a primary and independent stimulator for mtorc1 activation. the downstream target of mtorc1, the kinase s6k1, induces insulin resistance by phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, thereby increasing the metabolic burden of β-cells. moreover, leucine-mediated mtorc1-s6k1-signaling plays an important role in adipogenesis, thus increasing the risk of obesity-mediated insulin resistance. high consumption of leucine-rich proteins explains exaggerated mtorc1-dependent insulin secretion, increased β-cell growth and β-cell proliferation promoting an early onset of replicative β-cell senescence with subsequent β-cell apoptosis. disturbances of β-cell mass regulation with increased β-cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as insulin resistance are hallmarks of t2d, which are all associated with hyperactivation of mtorc1. in contrast, the anti-diabetic drug metformin antagonizes leucine-mediated mtorc1 signaling. plant-derived polyphenols and flavonoids are identified as natural inhibitors of mtorc1 and exert anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects. furthermore, bariatric surgery in obesity reduces increased plasma levels of leucine and other branched-chain amino acids. attenuation of leucine-mediated mtorc1 signaling by defining appropriate upper limits of the daily intake of leucine-rich animal and dairy proteins may offer a great chance for the prevention of t2d and obesity, as well as other epidemic diseases of civilization with increased mtorc1 signaling, especially cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, which are frequently associated with t2d."}

{"query": "leucine", "gold_doc": "dr (dietary restriction), or reduced food intake without malnutrition, is associated with extended longevity, improved metabolic fitness and increased stress resistance in a wide range of organisms. dr is often referred to as calorie restriction, implying that reduced energy intake is responsible for its widespread and evolutionarily conserved benefits. however, recent data indicate dietary amino acid restriction as a key mediator of dr benefits. in fruitflies, an imbalance in essential amino acid intake is thought to underlie longevity benefits of dr. in mammals, reduced dietary protein or essential amino acid intake can extend longevity, improve metabolic fitness and increase stress resistance. in the present paper we review two evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathways responsible for sensing amino acid levels. the eif2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2α) kinase gcn2 (general amino acid control non-derepressible 2) senses the absence of one or more amino acids by virtue of direct binding to uncharged cognate trnas. the presence of certain amino acids, such as leucine, permits activation of the master growth regulating kinase tor (target of rapamycin). these two signal transduction pathways react to amino acid deprivation by inhibiting general protein translation while at the same time increasing translation of specific mrnas involved in restoring homoeostasis. together, these pathways may contribute to the regulation of longevity, metabolic fitness and stress resistance."}

{"query": "preventing brain loss with b vitamins?", "gold_doc": "various pesticides are being used to destabilize, perturb, or inhibit crucial biochemical and physiological targets related to metabolism, growth, development, nervous communication, or behavior in pestiferous organisms. chitin is an eukaryotic extracellular aminosugar biopolymer, massively produced by most fungal systems and by invertebrates, notably arthropods. being an integral supportive component in fungal cell wall, insect cuticle, and nematode egg shell, chitin has been considered as a selective target for pesticide action. throughout the elaborate processes of chitin formation and deposition, only the polymerization events associated with the cell membrane compartment are so far available for chemical interference. currently, the actinomycetes-derived nucleoside peptide fungicides such as the polyoxins and the insecticidal benzoylaryl ureas have reached commercial pesticide status. the polyoxins and other structurally-related antibiotics like nikkomycins are strong competitive inhibitors of the polymerizing enzyme chitin synthase. the exact biochemical lesion inflicted by the benzoylaryl ureas is still elusive, but a post-polymerization event, such as translocation of chitin chains across the cell membrane, is suggested. hydrolytic degradation of the chitin polymer is essential for hyphal growth, branching, and septum formation in fungal systems as well as for the normal molting of arthropods. recently, insect chitinase activity was strongly and specifically suppressed by allosamidin, an actimomycetes-derived metabolite. in part, the defense mechanism in plants against invasion of pathogens is associated with induced chitinases. chitin, chitosan, and their oligomers are able to act as elicitors which induce enhanced levels of chitinases in various plants. lectins which bind to n-acetyl-d-glucosamine strongly interfere with fungal and insect chitin synthases. plant lectins with similar properties may be involved in plant-pathogen interaction inter alia by suppressing fungal invasion."}

{"query": "grapes", "gold_doc": "fisetin, a flavonol present in vegetables and fruits, possesses antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. in this study, we have demonstrated that fisetin prevents diet-induced obesity through regulation of the signaling of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1), a central mediator of cellular growth, cellular proliferation and lipid biosynthesis. to evaluate whether fisetin regulates mtorc1 signaling, we investigated the phosphorylation and kinase activity of the 70-kda ribosomal protein s6 kinase 1 (s6k1) and mtorc1 in 3t3-l1 preadipocytes. fisetin treatment of preadipocytes reduced the phosphorylation of s6k1 and mtorc1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. to further our understanding of how fisetin negatively regulates mtorc1 signaling, we analyzed the phosphorylation of s6k1, mtor and akt in fisetin-treated tsc2-knockdown cells. the results suggested that fisetin treatment inhibits mtorc1 activity in an akt-dependent manner. recent studies have shown that adipocyte differentiation is dependent on mtorc1 activity. fisetin treatment inhibited adipocyte differentiation, consistent with the negative effect of fisetin on mtor. the inhibitory effect of fisetin on adipogenesis is dependent of mtor activity, suggesting that fisetin inhibits adipogenesis and the accumulation of intracellular triglycerides during adipocyte differentiation by targeting mtorc1 signaling. fisetin supplementation in mice fed a high-fat diet (hfd) significantly attenuated hfd-induced increases in body weight and white adipose tissue. we also observed that fisetin efficiently suppressed the phosphorylation of akt, s6k1 and mtorc1 in adipose tissue. collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of mtorc1 signaling by fisetin prevents adipocyte differentiation of 3t3-l1 preadipocytes and obesity in hfd-fed mice. therefore, fisetin may be a useful phytochemical agent for attenuating diet-induced obesity. copyright © 2013 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."}

{"query": "caloric restriction", "gold_doc": "a considerable amount of evidence is consistent with the proposition that systemic igf-i activity acts as pacesetter in the aging process. a reduction in igf-i activity is the common characteristic of rodents whose maximal lifespan has been increased by a wide range of genetic or dietary measures, including caloric restriction. the lifespans of breeds of dogs and strains of rats tend to be inversely proportional to their mature weight and igf-i levels. the link between igf-i and aging appears to be evolutionarily conserved; in worms and flies, lifespan is increased by reduction-of-function mutations in signaling intermediates homologous to those which mediate insulin/igf-i activity in mammals. the fact that an increase in igf-i activity plays a key role in the induction of sexual maturity, is consistent with a broader role for-igf-i in aging regulation. if down-regulation of igf-i activity could indeed slow aging in humans, a range of practical measures for achieving this may be at hand. these include a low-fat, whole-food, vegan diet, exercise training, soluble fiber, insulin sensitizers, appetite suppressants, and agents such as flax lignans, oral estrogen, or tamoxifen that decrease hepatic synthesis of igf-i. many of these measures would also be expected to decrease risk for common age-related diseases. regimens combining several of these approaches might have a sufficient impact on igf-i activity to achieve a useful retardation of the aging process. however, in light of the fact that igf-i promotes endothelial production of nitric oxide and may be of especial importance to cerebrovascular health, additional measures for stroke prevention-most notably salt restriction-may be advisable when attempting to down-regulate igf-i activity as a pro-longevity strategy."}

{"query": "nuts", "gold_doc": "the antioxidant melatonin was recently identified in a variety of edible plants and seeds in high concentrations. in plants, as in animals, melatonin is believed to function as a free radical scavenger and possibly in photoperiodism. in this study, melatonin was detected and quantified in fresh-frozen balaton and montmorency tart cherries (prunus cerasus) using high-performance liquid chromatography. both cherry species contain high levels of melatonin compared to the melatonin concentrations in the blood of mammals. montmorency cherries (13.46 +/- 1.10 ng/g) contain approximately 6 times more melatonin than do balaton cherries (2.06 +/- 0.17 ng/g). neither the orchard of origin nor the time of harvest influenced the amount of melatonin in fresh cherries. the implication of the current findings is that consuming cherries could be an important source of dietary melatonin inasmuch as melatonin is readily absorbed when taken orally. also, previously published data and the results presented here show that melatonin is not only endogenously produced but also present in the diet."}

{"query": "sulfur", "gold_doc": "objective: fructose intake has increased considerably in the united states, primarily as a result of increased consumption of high-fructose corn syrup, fruits and juices, and crystalline fructose. the purpose was to determine how often fructose, in amounts commonly consumed, would result in malabsorption and/or symptoms in healthy persons. design: fructose absorption was measured using 3-hour breath hydrogen tests and symptom scores were used to rate subjective responses for gas, borborygmus, abdominal pain, and loose stools. subjects/setting: the study included 15 normal, free-living volunteers from a medical center community and was performed in a gastrointestinal specialty clinic. intervention: subjects consumed 25- and 50-g doses of crystalline fructose with water after an overnight fast on separate test days. main outcome measures: mean peak breath hydrogen, time of peak, area under the curve (auc) for breath hydrogen and gastrointestinal symptoms were measured during a 3-hour period after subjects consumed both 25- and 50-g doses of fructose. statistical analyses: differences in mean breath hydrogen, auc, and symptom scores between doses were analyzed using paired t tests. correlations among peak breath hydrogen, auc, and symptoms were also evaluated. results: more than half of the 15 adults tested showed evidence of fructose malabsorption after 25 g fructose and greater than two thirds showed malabsorption after 50 g fructose. auc, representing overall breath hydrogen response, was significantly greater after the 50-g dose. overall symptom scores were significantly greater than baseline after each dose, but scores were only marginally greater after 50 g than 25 g. peak hydrogen levels and auc were highly correlated, but neither was significantly related to symptoms. conclusions: fructose, in amounts commonly consumed, may result in mild gastrointestinal distress in normal people. additional study is warranted to evaluate the response to fructose-glucose mixtures (as in high-fructose corn syrup) and fructose taken with food in both normal people and those with gastrointestinal dysfunction. because breath hydrogen peaks occurred at 90 to 114 minutes and were highly correlated with 180-minute breath hydrogen auc, the use of peak hydrogen measures may be considered to shorten the duration of the exam."}

{"query": "serotonin", "gold_doc": "objectives: to inform the debate over whether human sleep can be chronically reduced without consequences, we conducted a dose-response chronic sleep restriction experiment in which waking neurobehavioral and sleep physiological functions were monitored and compared to those for total sleep deprivation. design: the chronic sleep restriction experiment involved randomization to one of three sleep doses (4 h, 6 h, or 8 h time in bed per night), which were maintained for 14 consecutive days. the total sleep deprivation experiment involved 3 nights without sleep (0 h time in bed). each study also involved 3 baseline (pre-deprivation) days and 3 recovery days. setting: both experiments were conducted under standardized laboratory conditions with continuous behavioral, physiological and medical monitoring. participants: a total of n = 48 healthy adults (ages 21-38) participated in the experiments. interventions: noctumal sleep periods were restricted to 8 h, 6 h or 4 h per day for 14 days, or to 0 h for 3 days. all other sleep was prohibited. results: chronic restriction of sleep periods to 4 h or 6 h per night over 14 consecutive days resulted in significant cumulative, dose-dependent deficits in cognitive performance on all tasks. subjective sleepiness ratings showed an acute response to sleep restriction but only small further increases on subsequent days, and did not significantly differentiate the 6 h and 4 h conditions. polysomnographic variables and delta power in the non-rem sleep eeg-a putative marker of sleep homeostasis--displayed an acute response to sleep restriction with negligible further changes across the 14 restricted nights. comparison of chronic sleep restriction to total sleep deprivation showed that the latter resulted in disproportionately large waking neurobehavioral and sleep delta power responses relative to how much sleep was lost. a statistical model revealed that, regardless of the mode of sleep deprivation, lapses in behavioral alertness were near-linearly related to the cumulative duration of wakefulness in excess of 15.84 h (s.e. 0.73 h). conclusions: since chronic restriction of sleep to 6 h or less per night produced cognitive performance deficits equivalent to up to 2 nights of total sleep deprivation, it appears that even relatively moderate sleep restriction can seriously impair waking neurobehavioral functions in healthy adults. sleepiness ratings suggest that subjects were largely unaware of these increasing cognitive deficits, which may explain why the impact of chronic sleep restriction on waking cognitive functions is often assumed to be benign. physiological sleep responses to chronic restriction did not mirror waking neurobehavioral responses, but cumulative wakefulness in excess of a 15.84 h predicted performance lapses across all four experimental conditions. this suggests that sleep debt is perhaps best understood as resulting in additional wakefulness that has a neurobiological \"cost\" which accumulates over time."}

{"query": "liver disease", "gold_doc": "the metabolic syndrome is a common complex entity that has emerged as a worldwide epidemic and major public health care concern with a prevalence of approximately 25% in the united states. there have been a number of different definitions of the metabolic syndrome but all center around the metabolic abnormalities of central obesity, hypertension, decreased high-density lipoproteins and elevated triglycerides with insulin resistance as the uniting physiologic factor. the importance of the metabolic syndrome is not just related to its high prevalence rate but also because it predicts the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is now recognized to be the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome, which along with its individual components - particularly diabetes and elevated triglycerides, are the major risk factors for the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash); the most severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. nash may progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. it is currently the third most common cause for liver transplantation and is projected to be the leading cause for liver transplantation in 2020. weight loss (via diet or bariatric surgery) and vitamin e have recently been demonstrated to be effective treatments of nash. although these and other agents may prove to be effective treatments for nash, the most effective therapeutic strategy would be early screening and intervention to prevent the development of insulin resistance and oxidative stress at a societal level. © 2011 the author. journal of digestive diseases © 2011 chinese medical association shanghai branch, chinese society of gastroenterology, renji hospital affiliated to shanghai jiaotong university school of medicine and blackwell publishing asia pty ltd."}
{"query": "beans", "gold_doc": "background and aims: the mechanisms of cancer cell growth and metastasis are still not entirely understood, especially from the viewpoint of chemical reactions in tumours. glycolytic metabolism is markedly accelerated in cancer cells, causing the accumulation of glucose (a reducing sugar) and methionine (an amino acid), which can non-enzymatically react and form carcinogenic substances. there is speculation that this reaction produces gaseous sulfur-containing compounds in tumour tissue. the aims of this study were to clarify the products in tumour and to investigate their effect on tumour proliferation. methods: products formed in the reaction between glucose and methionine or its metabolites were analysed in vitro using gas chromatography. flatus samples from patients with colon cancer and exhaled air samples from patients with lung cancer were analysed using near-edge x-ray fine adsorption structure spectroscopy and compared with those from healthy individuals. the tumour proliferation rates of mice into which ht29 human colon cancer cells had been implanted were compared with those of mice in which the cancer cells were surrounded by sodium hyaluronate gel to prevent diffusion of gaseous material into the healthy cells. results: gaseous sulfur-containing compounds such as methanethiol and hydrogen sulfide were produced when glucose was allowed to react with methionine or its metabolites homocysteine or cysteine. near-edge x-ray fine adsorption structure spectroscopy showed that the concentrations of sulfur-containing compounds in the samples of flatus from patients with colon cancer and in the samples of exhaled air from patients with lung cancer were significantly higher than in those from healthy individuals. animal experiments showed that preventing the diffusion of sulfur-containing compounds had a pronounced antitumour effect. conclusions: gaseous sulfur-containing compounds are the main products in tumours and preventing the diffusion of these compounds reduces the tumour proliferation rate, which suggests the possibility of a new approach to cancer treatment."}

{"query": "milk", "gold_doc": "the purpose of this paper is to highlight the endocrine signaling of western diet, a fundamental environmental factor involved in the pathogenesis of epidemic acne. western nutrition is characterized by high calorie uptake, high glycemic load, high fat and meat intake, as well as increased consumption of insulin- and igf-1-level elevating dairy proteins. metabolic signals of western diet are sensed by the nutrient-sensitive kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1), which integrates signals of cellular energy, growth factors (insulin, igf-1) and protein-derived signals, predominantly leucine, provided in high amounts by milk proteins and meat. mtorc1 activates srebp, the master transcription factor of lipogenesis. leucine stimulates mtorc1-srebp signaling and leucine is directly converted by sebocytes into fatty acids and sterols for sebaceous lipid synthesis. over-activated mtorc1 increases androgen hormone secretion and most likely amplifies androgen-driven mtorc1 signaling of sebaceous follicles. testosterone directly activates mtorc1. future research should investigate the effects of isotretinoin on sebocyte mtorc1 activity. it is conceivable that isotretinoin may downregulate mtorc1 in sebocytes by upregulation of nuclear levels of foxo1. the role of western diet in acne can only be fully appreciated when all stimulatory inputs for maximal mtorc1 activation, i.e., glucose, insulin, igf-1 and leucine, are adequately considered. epidemic acne has to be recognized as an mtorc1-driven disease of civilization like obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. these new insights into western diet-mediated mtorc1-hyperactivity provide a rational basis for dietary intervention in acne by attenuating mtorc1 signaling by reducing (1) total energy intake, (2) hyperglycemic carbohydrates, (3) insulinotropic dairy proteins and (4) leucine-rich meat and dairy proteins. the necessary dietary changes are opposed to the evolution of industrialized food and fast food distribution of westernized countries. an attenuation of mtorc1 signaling is only possible by increasing the consumption of vegetables and fruit, the major components of vegan or paleolithic diets. the dermatologist bears a tremendous responsibility for his young acne patients who should be advised to modify their dietary habits in order to reduce activating stimuli of mtorc1, not only to improve acne but to prevent the harmful and expensive march to other mtorc1-related chronic diseases later in life."}

{"query": "starving tumors of their blood supply", "gold_doc": "several epidemiological studies have indicated that abundant consumption of foods from plant origin is associated with a reduced risk of developing several types of cancers. this chemopreventive effect is related to the high content of these foods in phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, that interfere with several processes involved in cancer progression including tumor cell growth, survival and angiogenesis. in addition to the low intake of plant-based foods, increased body mass and physical inactivity have recently emerged as other important lifestyle factors influencing cancer risk, leading to the generation of low-grade chronic inflammatory conditions which are a key process involved in tumor progression. the objectives of the current study are to investigate the inhibitory effects of these polyphenols on angiogenesis triggered by an inflammatory cytokine (il-6) and to determine the mechanisms underlying this action. we found that, among the tested polyphenols, apigenin and luteolin were the most potent angiogenesis inhibitors through their inhibitory effect on the inflammatory cytokine il-6/stat3 pathway. these effects resulted in modulation of the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 signaling triggered by il-6, as well as in a marked reduction in the proliferation, migration and morphogenic differentiation of endothelial cells. interestingly, these polyphenols also modulated the expression of il-6 signal transducing receptor (il-6rα) and the secretion of the extracellular matrix degrading enzyme mmp-2 as well as the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (socs3) protein. overall, these results may provide important new information on the role of diet in cancer prevention. copyright © 2012 elsevier inc. all rights reserved."}

{"query": "milk", "gold_doc": "rainfall samples were collected during the 2003 and 2004 growing seasons at four agricultural locales across the usa in maryland, indiana, nebraska, and california. the samples were analyzed for 21 insecticides, 18 herbicides, three fungicides, and 40 pesticide degradates. data from all sites combined show that 7 of the 10 most frequently detected pesticides were herbicides, with atrazine (70%) and metolachlor (83%) detected at every site. dacthal, acetochlor, simazine, alachlor, and pendimethalin were detected in more than 50% of the samples. chlorpyrifos, carbaryl, and diazinon were the only insecticides among the 10 most frequently detected compounds. of the remaining pesticide parent compounds, 18 were detected in fewer than 30% of the samples, and 13 were not detected. the most frequently detected degradates were deethylatrazine; the oxygen analogs (oas) of the organophosphorus insecticides chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion; and 1-napthol (degradate of carbaryl). deethylatrazine was detected in nearly 70% of the samples collected in maryland, indiana, and nebraska but was detected only once in california. the oas of chlorpyrifos and diazinon were detected primarily in california. degradates of the acetanilide herbicides were rarely detected in rain, indicating that they are not formed in the atmosphere or readily volatilized from soils. herbicides accounted for 91 to 98% of the total pesticide mass deposited by rain except in california, where insecticides accounted for 61% in 2004. the mass of pesticides deposited by rainfall was estimated to be less than 2% of the total applied in these agricultural areas."}
{"query": "starving tumors of their blood supply", "gold_doc": "objective: although several studies have reported associations of depressive state with specific nutrients and foods, few studies examined the association with dietary patterns in adults. we investigated the association between major dietary patterns and depressive symptoms in japanese. methods: subjects were 521 municipal employees (309 men and 212 women), aged 21-67 years, who participated in a health survey at the time of periodic checkup. depressive symptoms were assessed using the center for epidemiologic studies depression (ces-d) scale. dietary patterns were derived by using principal component analysis of the consumption of 52 food and beverage items, which was assessed by a validated brief diet history questionnaire. logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios of depressive symptoms (ces-d >or=16) with adjustment for potential confounding variables. results: we identified three dietary patterns. a healthy japanese dietary pattern characterized by high intakes of vegetables, fruit, mushrooms and soy products was associated with fewer depressive symptoms. the multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of having depressive symptoms for the lowest through highest tertiles of the healthy japanese dietary pattern score were 1.00 (reference), 0.99 (0.62-1.59) and 0.44 (0.25-0.78), respectively (p for trend=0.006). other dietary patterns were not appreciably associated with depressive symptoms. conclusions: our findings suggest that a healthy japanese dietary pattern may be related to decreased prevalence of depressive status."}
{"query": "anisakis", "gold_doc": "after observing a patient allergic to cat dander and pork but devoid of other allergies, we prospectively screened patients known to be allergic to cat for a second sensitization to pork. after collecting the sera of 10 young patients found to contain specific ige to cat dander and pork, we undertook this study to detect the possible cross-reactive allergen, define its molecular characteristics, and evaluate its clinical relevance. through immunoblotting techniques, cat and porcine serum albumin were found to be jointly recognized molecules. these findings were further analyzed by specific anti-albumin ige titrations and cross-inhibition experiments. cat serum albumin cdna was obtained from cat liver, and the corresponding amino acid sequence was deduced and compared to the known porcine and human serum albumin sequences. inhibition experiments showed that the spectrum of ige reactivity to cat serum albumin completely contained ige reactivity to porcine serum albumin, suggesting that sensitization to cat was the primary event. in two cohorts of cat-allergic persons, the frequency of sensitization to cat serum albumin was found to lie between 14% and 23%. sensitization to porcine albumin was found to lie between 3% and 10%. about 1/3 of these persons are likely to experience allergic symptoms in relation to pork consumption. sensitization to cat serum albumin should be considered a useful marker of possible cross-sensitization not only to porcine serum albumin but also to other mammalian serum albumins."}
{"query": "grapes", "gold_doc": "three recent case-control studies conclude that diets high in animal fat or cholesterol are associated with a substantial increase in risk for parkinson's disease (pd); in contrast, fat of plant origin does not appear to increase risk. whereas reported age-adjusted prevalence rates of pd tend to be relatively uniform throughout europe and the americas, sub-saharan black africans, rural chinese, and japanese, groups whose diets tend to be vegan or quasi-vegan, appear to enjoy substantially lower rates. since current pd prevalence in african-americans is little different from that in whites, environmental factors are likely to be responsible for the low pd risk in black africans. in aggregate, these findings suggest that vegan diets may be notably protective with respect to pd. however, they offer no insight into whether saturated fat, compounds associated with animal fat, animal protein, or the integrated impact of the components of animal products mediates the risk associated with animal fat consumption. caloric restriction has recently been shown to protect the central dopaminergic neurons of mice from neurotoxins, at least in part by induction of heat-shock proteins; conceivably, the protection afforded by vegan diets reflects a similar mechanism. the possibility that vegan diets could be therapeutically beneficial in pd, by slowing the loss of surviving dopaminergic neurons, thus retarding progression of the syndrome, may merit examination. vegan diets could also be helpful to pd patients by promoting vascular health and aiding blood-brain barrier transport of l-dopa. copyright 2001 harcourt publishers ltd."}
{"query": "nuts", "gold_doc": "summary sedentary activity is a modifiable life-style behavior and a key component in the etiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (acvd). us adults and children spend more than half their waking time in sedentary pursuits. sedentary activity has been shown to result in impaired insulin sensitivity, impaired metabolic function and attenuated endothelial function, which are classic markers of acvd. sedentary activity is defined as ‘sitting without otherwise being active.’ this behavior promotes reduced muscular activity of the lower extremities which decreases leg blood flow, increases blood pooling in the calf, augments mean arterial pressure, and deforms arterial segments resulting in low mean shear stress (ss). ss activates distinct physiological mechanisms which have been proposed to be protective against acvd; specifically through a ss-induced endothelium-derived nitric oxide mechanism. reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide creates a pro-oxidant milieu resulting in increased oxidative stress. there is sufficient evidence which demonstrates that endothelial function is attenuated in the presence of oxidative stress. sedentary activity results in low ss in the lower extremities which may result in increased oxidative stress and impaired endothelial function. this review furthers the use of sitting as model to study the effects of inactivity, discusses possible physiological mechanisms and suggests future directions."}
{"query": "alternative medicine", "gold_doc": "this systematic review aims to summarize all reported cases of cardiac tamponade after acupuncture. five electronic databases and our own files were searched for reports of cardiac tamponade after acupuncture. no restrictions in time or language were imposed. data were extracted by two independent reviewers according to predefined criteria. we found a total of 26 cases. in 14 patients, the complications were fatal. in most instances, there is little doubt about causality. we conclude that cardiac tamponade is a serious, often fatal complication after acupuncture. as it is theoretically avoidable, acupuncturists should be trained to minimize the risk. copyright © 2010 elsevier ireland ltd. all rights reserved."}
{"query": "growth promoters", "gold_doc": "endocrine research in the 1930s increased and extended the use of sex hormones as medical therapies in an unprecedented way, especially for female ailments. in the 1950s the therapeutic use of sex hormones extended to the treatment of 'tall' girls. ambiguity in the definition of the 'tall' girl, the arbitrary nature of the treatment decision, and diversity in the therapeutic regimes highlight the problematic nature of this medical practice. using linguistic repertoires to study the political and ideological implications found in the patterned use of language, this paper reports on a discourse analysis of the medical literature on treatment of tall girls between the 1950s and 1990s, when this treatment was at its peak. three linguistic repertoires emerged: the institutional authority of medicine to determine the 'abnormality' of tall stature in females; the clinical knowledge and experience in the diagnosis of medical risk associated with tall stature in women; and using hormones as cosmetic therapy to (re)produce femininity in tall girls. all three related to the maintenance of the cultural representations and social expectations of femininity. with no evidence of psychological harm associated with tall stature in women, and no long-term studies of either effectiveness or benefit, over five decades clinicians persuaded themselves and their patients that tall stature required therapeutic intervention. the treatment of tall girls with high dose oestrogen must be viewed as the medicalisation of a normal physical attribute adversely related to the social construction of gender. copyright 2010 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved."}
